# Bridge Conventions - Quick Reference

## Common Conventions After 1NT Opening

### Stayman Convention
**When:** Partner opens 1NT  
**You bid:** 2♣  
**Meaning:** "Do you have a 4-card major (hearts or spades)?"

**Partner's Responses:**
- 2♦ = No 4-card major
- 2♥ = 4+ hearts (may also have 4 spades)
- 2♠ = 4 spades (no 4 hearts)

**Example:**
```
Partner: 1NT
You: 2♣ (Stayman - asking about majors)
Partner: 2♥ (showing 4 hearts)
You: 4♥ (game in hearts)
```

**When to use:** You have 4 cards in a major and game-going values (8+ HCP)

### Jacoby Transfers
**When:** Partner opens 1NT  
**You bid:** 2♦ or 2♥  
**Meaning:** "Bid my 5+ card major, partner!"

**How it works:**
- **2♦** = Transfer to hearts (you have 5+ hearts)
- **2♥** = Transfer to spades (you have 5+ spades)

Partner MUST accept the transfer by bidding the next suit up.

**Example:**
```
Partner: 1NT
You: 2♥ (transfer - you have 6 spades)
Partner: 2♠ (accepting transfer)
You: Pass (or bid on with more strength)
```

**Why transfer?** 
1. Makes partner (the strong hand) the declarer
2. Protects partner's honors from opening lead
3. Allows you to show your hand type

### Texas Transfers
**When:** Partner opens 1NT, you have 6+ cards and game values  
**You bid:** 4♦ or 4♥  
**Meaning:** "We're playing game in my major - accept it!"

- **4♦** = Transfer to 4♥ (6+ hearts, game-forcing)
- **4♥** = Transfer to 4♠ (6+ spades, game-forcing)

## Other Common Conventions

### Negative Double
**When:** Partner opens, RHO overcalls  
**You bid:** X (double)  
**Meaning:** "I have values and cards in unbid suits, especially unbid majors"

**Example:**
```
Partner: 1♣
RHO: 1♥ (overcall)
You: X (negative double - showing spades and values)
```

### Michaels Cue Bid
**When:** Opponent opens a suit  
**You bid:** Same suit at 2-level  
**Meaning:** "I have 5-5 in two suits"

**Which suits:**
- Over 1♣: 2♣ = Both majors (5 hearts, 5 spades)
- Over 1♦: 2♦ = Both majors
- Over 1♥: 2♥ = Spades + minor (5 spades, 5 clubs or diamonds)
- Over 1♠: 2♠ = Hearts + minor

---

### Unusual 2NT
**When:** Opponent opens, you have two long minor suits  
**You bid:** 2NT  
**Meaning:** "I have 5-5 in both minors (clubs and diamonds)"

---

### Blackwood (4NT)
**When:** Considering slam  
**You bid:** 4NT  
**Meaning:** "How many aces do you have?"

**Responses:**
- 5♣ = 0 or 4 aces
- 5♦ = 1 ace
- 5♥ = 2 aces
- 5♠ = 3 aces

## Important Distinctions

### 2♣ as Stayman vs Strong 2♣ Opening

**Different meanings:**

1. **Stayman (2♣ response to 1NT):**
   - Partner opened 1NT
   - You bid 2♣
   - This asks about majors
   - Example: `Partner: 1NT, You: 2♣`

2. **Strong 2♣ Opening:**
   - YOU open 2♣ (not after 1NT!)
   - Shows 22+ HCP
   - Game-forcing
   - Example: `You: 2♣ (opening), Partner: 2♦ (waiting)`

**Key difference:** 
- Stayman = Response to partner's 1NT
- Strong 2♣ = Opening bid showing massive strength

---

## When NOT to Use Conventions

**Don't use Stayman/Transfers over OPPONENT's 1NT!**

If opponent opens 1NT:
- You should: Overcall with a suit, double, or pass
- You should NOT: Bid 2♣ "Stayman" - that's only for YOUR PARTNER's 1NT!

**Example of WRONG:**
```
Opponent: 1NT
You: 2♣ ❌ (This is NOT Stayman - it's just a weak bid or natural clubs)
```

**Example of CORRECT:**
```
Your Partner: 1NT
Opponent: Pass
You: 2♣ ✅ (This IS Stayman - asking partner about majors)
```
